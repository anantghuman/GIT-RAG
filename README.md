# GIT-RAG
Full-Stack Summary of the “Git-RAG” Application
(A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that turns every branch, commit, and file in a GitHub organization into a semantically searchable, zero-trust knowledge engine.)
1. Mission & User Value
• Goal: Let any authorized developer ask natural-language questions (e.g., “When was JWT auth added to payments.py and why?”) and instantly receive answers with line-level citations to specific SHAs, branch names, and diffs.
• Why it matters: Eliminates days of tribal-knowledge hunting, accelerates code reviews, surfaces security regressions, and provides auditable explanations for how and why code has evolved.
2. Core Capabilities
Total-history coverage – indexes every branch and tag, not just default.
Real-time ingestion – new pushes become searchable within <10 seconds via GitHub webhooks.
Code-aware semantics – uses function-level chunking and code-specialized embeddings so queries understand identifiers, comments, and idioms.
Row-level access control – filters results by GitHub team membership; revoked users lose access immediately.
Explainable answers – returns a conversational summary plus exact file paths, line numbers, and a clickable diff viewer.
Tamper-proof audit – logs every query/response pair, hashes them nightly, and anchors the hash on an L2 blockchain for SOC-2 evidence.
Self-service UX – web UI and optional VS Code sidebar; both stream answers token-by-token for perceived speed.
One-click deploy – Docker Compose + Terraform spin up all cloud resources, allowing recruiters to reproduce in 15 minutes.

4. Data Flow (Detailed)
Bootstrap mirror clone
git clone --mirror pulls every ref into a bare repo; SHAs are enumerated with git log --all --pretty=%H.
Commit walk & chunking
• For each SHA, list changed files via git show --name-only.
• For each file blob:
– Parse with tree-sitter; split by function/class (≈150–300 tokens each).
– Tag metadata: {sha, branch, path, lang, teams, timestamp}.
• For commit messages and diffs, treat each hunk as its own chunk.
Embedding
• Text & diffs → OpenAI text-embedding-3-small.
• Code blobs → OpenAI text-embedding-3-large or code-search-ada.
• Embeddings + metadata upserted into the vector DB in batches of 100 to minimize network overhead.
Real-time updates
• GitHub push webhook fires; payload lists new SHAs + branch.
• Serverless worker fetches only delta SHAs; same chunk-embed-upsert pipeline.
Query path
• Frontend obtains id_token (OAuth) → passes to API.
• API pulls caller’s GitHub teams; constructs filter team_tags IN (…).
• Embedding of question is produced on the fly; vector search returns top-k (hybrid BM25 + cosine).
• LangChain RetrievalQA feeds the snippets to GPT-4o with system prompt: “Answer concisely, cite sha/path.”
Response + citation
• Result streamed back to UI; each citation is a deep link:
https://github.com/org/repo/blob/<sha>/<path>#L45-L67.
5. Security & Compliance Measures
• Zero-trust networking: All traffic over mTLS; ingress allowed only via API Gateway.
• Confidential computing (optional): LLM call executed inside Azure DCsv3 enclave—embeddings stay encrypted in RAM.
• Row-level ACL: Vector filter plus post-retrieval check ensure no snippet escapes its allowed audience.
• Audit log: Every {user, query, sha_list, timestamp} appended to an immutable bucket; nightly Merkle root pinned to Polygon.
• PII scrubbing: Regex/NER pass at ingestion removes emails, secrets, and API keys from vectors.
6. DevOps & Cost Control
• Infrastructure-as-Code: Terraform module provisions vector index, key vault, serverless workers, and private subnets.
• Autoscaling: Worker pod counts scale on webhook queue depth; vector DB scales RBAC throughput units.
• Cost guardrails: Skip LLM generation if top-k vector scores < 0.25; fallback to lexical search reply.
• Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards show ingest latency, query p95, token spend/day, and failed ACL checks.
7. Extensibility Hooks
Graph mode: Import commit DAG into Neo4j; enable “why” answers via graph walks.
Code-review bot: Run RetrievalQA on diff in a PR; comment if patterns appear insecure compared to historical fixes.
Carbon-aware routing: Predict CO₂ per query; choose green region for LLM call.
IDE plugins: VS Code, JetBrains, and Neovim extensions reuse the same API.
8. Deliverables & Demo Assets
GitHub repo – MIT-licensed code, Docker-Compose, Terraform.
README white-paper – architecture diagram, threat model, benchmarking table (1 M vectors ≈ 220 ms p95).
Loom video (≤ 3 min) – push a commit, ask a question, watch answer stream with diff viewer.
Badges – “One-Click Deploy”, “Confidential-VM Ready”, “SOC-2 Controls Covered”.
Optional blog post – “From Git History to Semantic Search: Building Git-RAG in 4 Weeks”.
